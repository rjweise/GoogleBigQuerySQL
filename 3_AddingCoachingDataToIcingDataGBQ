Assuming I have two files in Google Big Query (GBQ):
* 1_NHL_PbP_HtmlReports_2010_2018g707_ICINGevents (all play by play data from 2010 until current, but only etype = ICING)
* NHLCoachesg2010020001_g2017020704 (coaches for home and away teams since 2010 to current)

Let's create the SourceGameNR field in the ICING data and fill it with the right data to link to the COACH data:

#standardSQL
UPDATE NHLplaybyplay.1_NHL_PbP_HtmlReports_2010_2018g707_ICINGevents
SET SourceGameNR = CONCAT('game',SUBSTR(CAST(season AS STRING),1,4),"0", CAST(gcode AS STRING)) WHERE etype = "ICING"

Let's join the two tables (ICING and COACH) based on the SourceGameNR

#standardSQL
SELECT ICING.* EXCEPT(SourceGameNR, HomeCoach, AwayCoach),
COACH.HcoachName,
COACH.AcoachName,
COACH.SourceGameNR,
COACH.Hteam,
COACH.Ateam,
COACH.HteamID,
COACH.AteamID
FROM NHLplaybyplay.1_NHL_PbP_HtmlReports_2010_2018g707_ICINGevents AS ICING
JOIN NHLplaybyplay.NHLCoachesg2010020001_g2017020704 AS COACH
ON ICING.SourceGameNR = COACH.SourceGameNR

We'll save this join as a new table (3_NHL_PbP_HtmlReports_2010_2018g707_ICINGevents_JOIN_coaches) in which we can calculate some fields, using the same logic to define the iced and icing team to the iced and icing coaches (run the SET statements one by one)

#standardSQL
UPDATE NHLplaybyplay.3_NHL_PbP_HtmlReports_2010_2018g707_ICINGevents_JOIN_coaches
SET IcingCoach = HcoachName WHERE homezone = "Def"

SET IcedCoach = AcoachName WHERE homezone = "Def"

SET IcingCoach = AcoachName WHERE homezone = "Off"

SET IcedCoach = HcoachName WHERE homezone = "Off"

We now have the table with all data for teams and coaches.
