# Very similar to the NHLscrapR code posted as a different repository, here is the R-code I used to pull daily PBP files from the NHL API per season

# Load library and set work directory (note the folder needs to exist already)
library(nhlscrapr)
setwd("/Users/rjweise/Downloads/2017/NHLscrapr/20142015")

#Set the season you want to load files for
SEASON <- "20142015"

#looping through the games in a season
gamenumber <- 0
for(i in 1:1500) { #non-existent or empty games will still create a csv file, but these will be easy to recognize based on file size

#counting the number of characters in the game number (i) to determine what to add in front to match the gamenumber style of NHL
g <- nchar(i)
  if(g==1) { 
    GID <- paste0("2000", i)
  } else if (g==2) {
    GID <- paste0("200", i)
  } else if (g==3) {
    GID <- paste0("20", i)
  } else GID <- paste0("2", i)
  
  #Now load the daily file into GameNAme using the NHLscrapr package
  GameName <- process.single.game(season=SEASON, gcode=GID, rdata.folder="20142015", override.download = TRUE)
  #retrieve.game(season=SEASON, gcode = GID)
  
  #load the game into a dataframe
  DFName <- data.frame(GameName$playbyplay)
  
  #define the file name
  name = paste("PbPgame20140", GID, sep = "")
  CSVname = paste(name, ".CSV", sep = "")
  
  #write the data to csv
  write.csv(DFName, file = CSVname)
}

#Use cat *.csv > merged.csv in Terminal on Mac
